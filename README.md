Star Wars Character Encyclopedia

Welcome to the Star Wars Character Encyclopedia! This web application allows you to explore detailed information about characters from the Star Wars universe, powered by the SWAPI GraphQL API.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Make sure you have Node.js version 18.17.0 or higher installed on your machine. If you're using an older version, you'll need to update it.

If you're using nvm to manage Node versions, you can switch to the correct version with the following command:

```bash
nvm use 18.17.0

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/star-wars-character-encyclopedia.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd star-wars-character-encyclopedia

3. Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install


## Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Features

Character List: View a list of Star Wars characters with search and sort functionality.
Character Details: Click on a character to see detailed information, including species, homeworld, and films they appeared in.
Mobile-First Design: The app is designed to be fully responsive, with a focus on mobile usability.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
